0,Wrong information on website. Overpriced.,"We checked the menu on the website and decided the bistro was a nice choice for sharing appetizers and a few entrees amongst us. We rarely order desert. To our surprise, the menu at the restaurant had nothing to do with the advertised one. It... was a ‚Äúspecial‚Äù 3 course (appetizer/entree/desert) very expensive menu which ruined our plans. We decided to stay but the food was simply not great - not worth the bill. Very disappointing. Please update your website with accurate information."
1,Magical wine dinner at Vero,"The Wine dinner at Vero bistro moderne is Spectacular! Just Wanna share some of dishes which their wine pairings are also magical. Hope they will organize similar event very soon. I look forward to it. üç∑üç∑üç∑ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ ‚Äî in Kensington, Calgary."
2,A wonderful meal and evening,"We were on vacation in Calgary, and we found Vero Bistro on line, while planning our trip. The reviews were great, and I must say they were right. We shared the crab spring roll, which was different and tasty. I had the Alberta lamb entree... and my husband had the garganelli, pasta dish. They were both excellent. My lamb dish was one of the best I have ever had. Our server, Chad was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Even though we were full, we wanted to try a dessert - we shared their ricotta cheese cake, which was wonderful, light and the perfect end to our meal. If we ever find ourselves visiting Calgary again, we will definitely come back."
3,Excellent Family Dinner,"Had a fantastic family dinner at Vero. Dinner is always excellent and we were really looking forward to it. They accommodated my vegetarian children with amazing selections. Everyone was more than satisfied with the fantastic food. Service was excellent and very friendly. We have been... several times in the past, and we will continue to go and definitely recommend to anyone who will listen :) Amazing restaurant!"
4,Great food and great service,was recommended this place . All I can say is wow !. lovely fresh food and great exquisite flavours . Really quaint surroundings too. Well thought out dishes and well executed‚Ä¶with great service ‚Ä¶. Would Highly recommend

6,An exquisite meal,"The meal was outstanding, the service was friendly and knowledgeable and even though the restaurant was full of felt roomy enough."
7,Yummy food and excellent service,"We had the seafood platter to share. Food was excellent (even leftovers the next day we're yummy!), and the service was superb (thanks Jodi!)."
8,Almost perfect,"Very good Italian food, the Tartare was very well prepared pasta was cooked perfectly and with care had the Agnolotti with pork rag√π which was Flavourful and we'll seasoned, the only disappointment was the buratta which was dry and lacking the creaminess I am accustomed... at the price point for that dish I honestly expected a fresher product. Service was professional"
9,Wow - Unforgettable Dinner!!,"We had a booking mishap in the summer and was able to get a reservation this past weekend. I was with my coworkers and boss and we all agree that our dinner was an awesome experience, from service to ambience and to the quality and... taste of the food. We heard that their Steak and Frites were to 'die for' and all of us ordered it and yes, it was just that. Mouth watering morsels of meat that melted in your mouth, marinated, cooked and grilled to perfection and presented on a board with truffle parmesan fries, chimichurri and sprinkled with arugula. I'm getting hungry just typing those words out!! It was just that delicious!! Due to the miscommunication with our previous booking, Michael offered us all desserts. I had the tiramisu and it was light, fluffy and oh so yummy!! Perfect ending to the perfect meal. Thank you, Michael :)! As soon as I was in the car, I texted my family group chat and friends group chat that we had to check out Vero Bistro. And as soon as I got home, hubby asked if I had any left overs lol! And, yes, I always make sure I have leftovers for my 'self proclaimed master chef'. He quickly heated up the meat, just enough so it's not overcooked, as I had asked for 'medium' and was silently chewing for a few minutes. I know that when he's speechless, he is enjoying every bite and also analyzing what the ingredients were in the marinade. Between bites, he says, 'miso', 'mirin', etc. lol. His conclusion was that we just need to go to Vero Bistro for our next date night. We will be back very soon. (Also posted on other sites)"
10,AMAZING,"Amazing Service, the food was amazing!! We had lobster Mac and cheese, the best steak I have ever had, a small rack of lamb, a coconut mango shrimp salad. It‚Äôs was unbelievable!"
11,Vero bistro,"Exquisite Take Away!! Fine dining family style, full of flavor, high quality ingredients. Perfect with a grand cru from my cellar."
12,Awesome take away dinner,"We never get disappointed whenever we ordered take away from Vero!! Food are always fresh and delicious. Sometimes we don't even have to reheat our dishes when we got home. Anyone who haven't tried Vero yet, please do and this place is a MUST to... go place. After your first try, you will always want to go back and will never get disappointed. Chef is creative and talented. Staff are friendly and knowledgable of the wine selections. Now Vero will be opened next Wednesday, June 16th, don't forget to make a reservation."
13,Absolutely divine!,"Absolutely divine! My girl and I enjoy dining out and experiencing new restaurants we‚Äôve never been to. Vero was my birthday surprise and wow were we impressed! It‚Äôs chic, comfortable and has a great atmosphere. Our server Chad (fellow foodie) treated us so well, suggested... favourites from the menu and had perfect wine accompaniments!

This is a special place- great for date nights, foodies or just treating yourself to one of Canada‚Äôs best dining experiences. Of all the thousands of places we have enjoyed this is in top all time!
