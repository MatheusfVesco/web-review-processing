0,"As always, Most Enjoyable","We met a cousin from out of town for dinner, it was the perfect spot. We had a great visit and we all enjoyed our meals. Atmosphere was great, service was great, food was great!"
1,"Average food, great service","So, Caesar's Steak House was good but not great. We had the onion soup to start and this was my favourite part of the meal (beside the wine). Delicious! Then came the meal. The twice-baked potato was good but sadly, my filet mignon tasted like... it was cooked yesterday. The texture was good but honestly, it seemed too dry. I was so disappointed. On the bright side was our waitress, Emma. She was delightful. May be sticking with Hy's for our steak."
2,Excellent Meal and Great Service,"My son and his girlfriend were visiting from Toronto and wanted to check out a Calgary steakhouse so we chose this Calgary classic. The decor is straight out of the 70s when they first opened. We had cocktails, wine and steak dinners. Mine was still... a little too raw so I sent it back and it came back a perfect medium rare and they included another of those super delicious twice-baked potatoes. We shared an ice cream for dessert and it was perfect. The Easterners were impressed and promise to be back!"
3,Always Excellent,"I've been to Caesar's twice in the last couple of months. As usual, the meal was excellent. We both have certain diet restrictions, which Caesar's was more than happy to accommodate. Our server was amazing, and truly a delight. Will definitely eat there again and... again."
4,Amazing iconic restaurant in Calgary!,Wow! My business guests were VERY impressed. All of the staff we dealt with were excellent. ARNELL was our waiter and was very attentive knowledgeable and friendly. Everyone‚Äôs food was superb! My T-Bone Neptune was a real treat. Thank you to Gerry Stuart and the... whole Caesars team. You gave us a great experience and made me look good to my guests. Well done and THANK YOU!
5,"Good meal, service so so","Reading other reviews I was prepared to be showered with great service. Sadly the waiter rushed us through as if it was just before closing time (630PM reservation, arrived on time and out the door by 730). Food was good and reasonably priced but I... am not one to want to order my food at the same time as my cocktails even when telling the waiter I would like to enjoy my drink first"
6,Perfect as always!,"As can be expected, Caesar's always delivers but we had the added treat this time of having Louis as our server. Louis was one of the most polished servers I have met in my life. He was charming, engaging, responsive, attentive, and interesting. He made... it a memorable experience. Thank you!"
7,Best experience,"I came with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday. The place was just exceptional. The servers were kind and considering, and going out of their way to make us feel welcome and enjoy our meal."
8,Excellent,"Excellent service, amazing food , great place - highly recommend to anyone visiting Calgary Will definitely be back soon"
9,Ahmed Khan,"Worst experience ever, we went out to dine after ages and feel really terrible about this situation. Really regret going to this place. I went to Caesar‚Äôs steak House and lounge (downtown location)with my family, I had an infant and a toddler. My infant was... in a stroller. We had a reservation. The receptionist told us to wait, and seated the other two gentlemen that came after us who didn‚Äôt even have a reservation. AFTER 5 minutes they came and told us that we are not allowed to enter with the stroller and they do not have any high chairs or booster seats for the kids (even though we called and told them this over the phone at the time of reservation). Worst experience ever! They made us feel very unwelcome and it was a shame my kids had to witness this cold behaviour of their‚Äôs. Will never come to this place again."
10,"Hail, Caesar!","Fast becoming my favorite steakhouse in Calgary! Food is excellent, portions are generous and service is always friendly and helpful. The tableside Caesar salad is a must have."
11,Definitely worth a visit,"Superb dining experience! Attentive, professional staff, lovely old school ambience, superb food and drinks. Thank you üôèüèº"
12,Best steakhouse restaurant in Canada.,"My wife and I were visiting Calgary from Ottawa, Ontario. We read all the reviews, and most of them were positive; we wanted to try the restaurant for ourselves. Well, we think it is the best steakhouse we have been too in Ottawa, Toronto, and... Vancouver. The steak was superb and was exactly medium rare. The twice baked potatoes were excellent and very tasty. We were then recommended the creme caramel which was to die for. Caesars is great restaurant with excellent food. Too bad we have a four plane ride to get to Calgary. We highly recommend Caesar's to those who are still undecided."
13,Best steakhouse,This is a wonderful steakhouse. The food was delicious and our steaks were cooked to perfection by our waiter Arnel (?). We were celebrating our friend‚Äôs birthday and management graciously offered a piece of pavlova which we all shared. Delicious! Will definitely come again when... next in Calgary.
14,A full night of enjoyment!,"I had never been to Caesars, nor had I ever heard of it. Honestly - Someone had posted a Tik Tok that I saw and I new I wanted to go! With the red leather, dim lighting and overall vibe, I felt like I was... in old time New York and this was the hidden gem of restaurants... kind of old school mobster vibes (in the best possible way). These are the places that remind me of a time that used to be... where cell phones were not a thing and we could just enjoy each other's conversation and company. Which is exactly what we did. We had a visitor from out of town who we had not seen for 9 years. We advised he was craving Alberta Beef. Caesar's delivered! Everything from drinks to the desert were epic and memorable. I personally ordered the Steak Anthony - WOW! Is all I have to say. My guests ordered the Steak Neptune X2 and the Ribs. Everything was delectable. I am booking another reservation to host a client for dinner and cannot wait to go back. Caesars reminded all of us what is it like to enjoy dinner with friends. We were there for 3.5 hours on a Saturday night and we could have stayed longer. We laughed, we ate and we shared. Thank you Caesars for your service, your food and for allowing us to break bread (which is also incredible!) See you in a week! Jillian"
15,AN OVERALL WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE,"The food was phenomenal from the appetizers, salad to the dinner. I had my 6 year old niece with me who loved the saut√©ed shrimp and garlic toast. She was doted on by all the staff and made to feel very special. I would not..."
16,Disappointed,We had good service and it was very interesting watching how the steaks were cooked. . The place seemed very dated and haven't moved with time. The menu seems it was stuck 80/90 decade . As I've worked in the fine food industry in that...
17,What is all this hype????,The table side Cesar said was $34....FOR SALAD. Are you nuts?? The plating of dinner was HIGHLY disappointing considering the extravagant cost. I think you'd find a fancier steak at a Cattleman's honestly. And the twice baked potato had an odd seasoning to it. Just...odd......
18,Perfection,The service was amazing. The food was perfection. The whole meal was an experience. I Highly recommend this place. It is worth the cost.
19,Saturday night dinner,All of the staff was so amazing and friendly when we came into the downtown location. Our server Mischa was spectacular; very attentive and outgoing. We visit regularly and can't recommend it enough?
20,Excellent service and meal!,"From our service in the lounge, through dinner to departure, service here was outstanding. We were a small group celebrating a special birthday and Mischa did an outstanding job of looking after us. Watching her prepare the table side caesar salad definitely added some fun..."
21,A Must Have!,"Can't say enough good things about Caesar's! To start, they changed the way I will forever make caesar salad. Getting the table side caesar salad to start was the best decision ever! To be able to see the technique was amazing, I was definitely the..."
22,Excellent business lunch,"Friendly staff greeted us, took our coats and seated us at a great table. Waiting staff was excellent and anticipated our needs very well. The steak sandwich was amazing as i have come to expect. Highly recommended"
23,"A big ""yes"" from Peter-Drake of Hexham Australia and teacher Clare of ""Queen Elizabeth High School""","We came here when visiting our daughter (a chemistry & science teacher at the local ""Queen Elizabeth High School) during the stampede. This time we came just the two of us and it was as terrific as the first time. If you are looking for..."

30,Classy Place,"Such a wonderful restaurant, especially for a specific occassion. A little overpriced but its completely worth it. My son and I shared a plate of escargot and was fabulous. They make the caesar salad right at your table which you dont find very often. We'll..."
31,Wonderful service and food!,"The service was phenomenal with a special shout-out to Mike who was friendly, attentive, and accommodating. I have a dairy allergy which was easily accommodated.

33,Saturday nite in calgary,"Hello tripaholics, here‚Äôs my take on Ceasars. Ambiance was everything expected from a well established property. Was kinda nice to get away from over the top modern straight line interiors. So many restaurants now are clinical their so modern, but Ceasars is resisting the upgrade..."
34,Simply the best,"It‚Äôs hard to top the excellent reviews by other recent diners but when you have such a great meal time-and-time again here it must be celebrated. With out doubt the best steak in Calgary, and we have dined here for 35 years. For our recent..."
35,Fantastic Meal - Wonderful service,"The young man checking us into our accommodation recommended us to Caesar's. We really enjoyed or meal, both had the smallest steak available, however there was a soup, salad, garlic or cheese bread included in the price. Appeared to be ""locals"" there which is always..."
36,Classic style steakhouse,"A classic steakhouse that has been here since the 1970‚Äôs, it doesn‚Äôt get much better for steak in Calgary. Old style decor may throw some folks off, but just wait until you start eating. Service is excellent, but can sometimes come across as arrogant, as..."
37,The best steak in Calgary!,"The steak is tastly seasoned and very juicy, the cheese and garlic toast is also the best in Calgary, the loaded baked potatoes are warm and very flavourful, the salad is average but has a nice dressing, and the French onion soup has a lot..."

39,Very good steaks and service!,We came back to Caesar's with family and loved the food and drinks and got great service (Jeremy is awesome).
40,Nice Surprise!,"We came here for an anniversary dinner and was pleasantly surprised. At first I was skeptical. The decor reminded me of the rat pack era, old school Vegas meets Ancient Rome. The food is delicious. For the price you're paying you get quite a bit..."
41,Caesar's annual performance review: EXCELLENT (again),SUMMARY: Despite the continued cloudy outlook for oil and gas prices Caesar's shows resolve and gains favour for not wavering on delivering quality and outstanding service. This is our 28th annual review since we upgraded our HR (Hometown Restaurants) evaluation model to the GS (Get...
42,Steaks galore,"Old school steakhouse. The rib eye steaks were great. And the Chateaubriand was also good and humongous! Service was a little slow, but then again, the steaks need to rest for 10 minutes before being served. The only one setback was that the waiter forgot..."
43,Always a treat!,"This was the first restaurant I went to when I moved to Calgary in 1971 - and has remained the 'special place' for a fine meal. Food is great, location is convenient and the decor fits the bill."

47,Delicious food and great service,Nice atmosphere with open fire grill. Steaks were perfectly cooked. Service was excellent. Four star review as there are no smaller cuts of steak on offer for smaller appetites and no good vegetable options to go with your steak entree. Vegetable was cucumbers and tomatoes...
48,Never had a better steak,Was recommended by our tour manager when staying overnight in Calgary. We had the fillet steak and I can honestly say it was equal to if not better than I have ever eaten in my life. Almost didn‚Äôt need a knife. Fantastic will definitely return...
49,25th work anniversary dinner,My office decided to host my 25th work anniversary dinner at Caesar's. We were a small party of 9 and whole experience was excellent. There is free valet parking after 5 p.m. The restaurant has an old fashioned look (but in a good way) and...

52,Disappointed,"A co-worker and I had a short lunch break so we decided that we didn't have time for steaks, and opted for salads instead. I ordered the wedge salad (15 dollars) and she the side caesar salad (10 dollars). For my coworker, there was what..."
53,expensive gristle,"I was at Caesar's for lunch and had the worst meal ever. The steak sandwich was almost inedible, it had so much gristle. The wait staff didn't come back to the table until everyone was done. I gave them my complaint and was told that..."

55,A CALGARY INSTITUTION,"Still after all these years Caesar's is a Calgary Institution and I wouldn't change a thing. The atmosphere, steak and wine are first class. The cheese bread is worth the trip on it's own."
56,A very good experience!,"Second time to visit, first time was some 20 years ago, and I had fond memories of Caesar's and they did not disappoint. Food was great, especially the steak. Service was first class! Love to go back!"
57,"Very romantic, delicious food, great ambiance!","The decor in this place makes you think Caesar's Palace the second you walk in. Apparently not much has changed since it opened in 1972, including the menu. Our coats were kindly checked when we arrived. Our server was great, explaining how everything works and..."
58,Not impressed,"Our first visit to Caesars. Service was horrible, the waiter messed up our sides, my baked potato was lukewarm, and wouldn't even melt the butter. The waiter pulled dirty forks out of his apron to put my new (now hot) baked potato on my plate..."
59,Really good food..lacking service.,"Really good food. The starters were delicious. French onion soup, garlic and cheese bread. The mixed green salad was pretty depressing. Rib Eye and Rack of Lamb were cooked to perfection! You can tell the protein were of higher grade meat as they were soft..."
60,Brutal,"Steaks under cooked, others sent back as they were tough. Waiters grumpy and then took them over 30 mins to figure out our bill. Just a gone show and ridiculously over priced. Avoid. The Keg is a better choice."
61,"""Wrinkle Free!"" 5 Out of 5!","Most enjoyable, from front to back! Reception and service was cordial and professional. Onion soup and house salad still a standard addition to your entre. Caesar salad( served table-side) was bullet proof! Steaks were cooked to order and perfection. A very complete wine menu---Martins were..."

64,Overpriced for what you get,"We had heard a lot about this steak house, so we tried it out. The food was alright, for steak. The price did not match the food. The steak was good, but comparable to The Keg, just three times the price of The Keg. The..."

67,THE place to get a great steak in Calgary,"Has been around forever but has continued to produce amazing dinners. I would personally recommend the Mark Anthony which consists of a lobster tail and filet mignon...absolutely amazing when paired with the asparagus. Consistently great food, with amazing service in a quiet environment."
68,"Great Steakhouse, excellent history, high quality service and overall expeerience.","Unfortunately, the recession has caused a slight downturn in meat grade and quality to compensate for reduced revenue stream, which is unfortunate as meat quality is reflected in meat grade noticeable lowered and inconsistency in overall product quality."
69,Still good but not excellent- I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if I could,"First of all, we have been coming to Caesar's downtown for years. My husband has attended so many business luncheons here that he knows the older waiters by name. When it came time to book a restaurant for a family members birthday, Caesar's was the..."
